# Welcome to Campuswire Analytics, created by Views From the Six

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command runs our app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# How To Use Our App

In the engagement page, you will find a bar graph, and a table. The goal is of the page is to inform the users of how the class and specific people have engaged with the campuswire page throughout the semester.

The graph shows user engagement throughout the semester by plotting the number of total user "actions" (posts, comments, likes, ...) for each day in the semester. 

The table below the graph shows the total posts, total comments, and last seen date for every person that has use the campuswire page. The last seen date is the last date that a user made a post or comment. By default, the table shows the data for 10 people at a time. You can flip between pages in the table by clicking the arrows in the bottom right, and you can adjust how many rows are shows at a time using the dropdown in the bottom right.

You can sort the table by name, number of posts, number of comments, or last seen date by clicking the sort by button between the graph and the table, and you can choose ascending or descending by clicking the button to the right which says "Ascending" by default.
